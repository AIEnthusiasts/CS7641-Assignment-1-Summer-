# CS7641-Assignment-1-Summer
the code of assignment 1

To run the provided code files for evaluating machine learning models on the MNIST-like digits dataset and a synthetic spiral dataset, first ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or above) and the necessary libraries installed (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and torch). You can install these libraries using pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn torch. The Google Drive contains three files: MNISTdata.py (runs models on the MNIST dataset), SpiralData(Graph).ipynb (generates the spiral dataset and visualizes graphs), and SpiraldataComparison.py (generates the spiral dataset and compares models). Run each script by navigating to its directory in the terminal and executing python <script_name.py> for .py files, or opening the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and running the cells. These scripts will output training and testing accuracies and other relevant performance metrics, enabling comprehensive model evaluation and comparison.
